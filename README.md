# Brief description


### Building Fast Queries on a CSV file  
We will imagine that we own an online laptop store and want to build a way to answer a few different business questions about our inventory.

In general, the task is to create a class to search for specific information in the selected file. Next, measure its performance and then refine it so that it works faster.


### Hacker News posts: right post type and time for collecting the comments  
In this small project we will compare two types of posts from Hacker News (HN) site, filled with technology related posts, - Ask HN and Show HN.
Ask HN are posts where users asking for community advise, while Show HN are posts with intention to show other users something interesting.

The goal is to determine if Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average and do posts created at a certain time recieve more comments on average.

For realization we will use sample (20 000 out of 300 000 rows) from Hacker News data set - sample is made by omitting posts without comments, and then choosing rows randomly from the rest of the data.


### Which free apps are the most profitable on App Store and Google Play  
This project is about analysing applications free to download and install, where main source of revenue will be from in-apps ads. The thing is that the number of users on free apps is a key indicator of ad revenue of these apps.

The goal of the project is to understand which applications attract the users more in order to create a vision of those types of apps and, accordingly, vision of target audience of those apps.

This data representation helps us determine key features of most popular apps, and, in addition, which of those are the most profitable ones.
